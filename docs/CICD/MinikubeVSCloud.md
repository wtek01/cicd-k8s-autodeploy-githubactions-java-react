To help you decide between self-hosted GitHub Actions runners and cloud-based Kubernetes for your CI/CD system, I should understand the current state of your project. Let me explore what you have so far.
Based on the information gathered from your project documentation, I can provide you with a comparison between the two options you're considering:

## Option 1: Cloud-based Kubernetes (Full CI/CD)

**Advantages:**

- Fully managed Kubernetes cluster with high availability (multi-node)
- Better scalability for handling increased workloads
- Persistent storage options with proper backup capabilities
- Professional-grade security with HTTPS, proper certificate management
- 24/7 availability without manual intervention
- Built-in load balancing for your services
- Real domain name support with proper DNS

**Disadvantages:**

- Higher cost (you'll need to pay for cloud resources)
- More complex setup and management
- Requires cloud provider knowledge
- Potentially steeper learning curve

## Option 2: Self-hosted GitHub Actions Runner (Local CI/CD)

**Advantages:**

- Lower cost (uses your existing hardware)
- Complete control over your environment
- Excellent for learning CI/CD concepts hands-on
- Great for POC and personal projects
- Direct access to local resources without authentication complexity
- Faster development cycles for your learning purposes
- No cloud provider lock-in

**Disadvantages:**

- Limited by your local machine's resources
- Single point of failure without high availability
- Manual maintenance required (starting/stopping)
- Ephemeral storage (data can be lost on restarts)
- Limited security features
- Not accessible externally without additional setup

## Recommendation for Your Scenario

Since you mentioned this is a POC for learning purposes with potential future use for your projects:

**Go with Option 2: Self-hosted GitHub Actions Runner** for now because:

1. It's better suited for learning the fundamentals of CI/CD without cloud costs
2. Your documentation shows you've already got much of the self-hosted setup working
3. For a learning project, the simplicity and direct control are valuable
4. You can always migrate to a cloud-based solution later when your projects require it
5. The local setup gives you immediate feedback during development

As your skills grow and when you have actual production projects that need high availability, security, and scalability, you can migrate to Option 1. Your current setup actually provides a great foundation for that future migration, as you're already using Kubernetes manifests and GitHub Actions workflows that can be adapted for cloud deployment.
